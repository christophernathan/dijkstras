# dijkstras

A simple implementation of breadth-first search and dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path in an unweighted and weighted, respectively, directed graph. Uses a priority queue to rank and process adjacent nodes by shortest distance. For BFS, distance between adjacent nodes will be 1, so shortest path between 2 given nodes will always minimize nodes in the path. Global constants define the number of nodes per graph, maximum number of edges from each node, and maximum edge weight. Nodes will not have loops and will only have a maximum of 1 edge to any given node. Functions included for graph creation and visualization of the adjacency matrix that represents the graph. Compile using `g++ -o dijkstras dijkstras.cpp`. Then, run with `./dijkstras`.
